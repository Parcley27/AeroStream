# AeroStream
A free to use, live air traffic display for anywhere in the world. 

Currently hosted on a local IP at [http://192.168.86.24:3000/Aerostream%20Radar](http://192.168.86.24:3000/Aerostream%20Radar), though uptime is spotty for now.

Many thanks to [ADSB.lol](https://adsb.lol/) for live ATC data, as well as [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=3/71.34/-96.82) and [Carto Basemaps](https://carto.com/basemaps) for maps with the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) framework.

A local setup guide and proper hosting on an actual domain? Coming soon to [airtraffic.online](airtraffic.online)...
