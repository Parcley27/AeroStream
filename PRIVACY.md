# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 22, 2025

AeroStream is designed with privacy in mind; No personal information is collected, stored, or tracked.

## Information Used

-  **Location Data** - Your device location (if granted) is used only to center the map. 
   
-  **Location Privacy** - Your location information is sent to the AeroStream server so live data can be provided on the website. This can be avoided by self hosting your own proxy server.

-  **API Requests** - Your coordinates are sent to ADSB.lol to fetch aircraft data within your specified radius.

-  **Map Tiles** - Map requests are sent to OpenStreetMap and Carto to display map imagery.

## Information Saved

-  **No Storage** - No user data of any kind is stored on the AeroStream server, in your web browser, or using any other method.

## Information Tracked to User

-  **None** - AeroStream does not use cookies, analytics, or any tracking mechanisms.

## Third-Party Services

-  **[ADSB.lol](https://adsb.lol/)** - Provides live aircraft data.

-  **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)** - Map tile provider.

-  **[Carto](https://carto.com/basemaps)** - Map tile provider.

These services may have their own privacy policies governing data they receive from map and API requests.

## Your Control

-  **Revoke Access** - Location permissions can be revoked anytime through browser settings.

-  **Manual Coordinates** - Use manual coordinate entry instead of location access.

-  **Self-Host** - Run AeroStream locally for complete control over all data.

## Open Source

AeroStream is fully open source. You can review the code at [github.com/Parcley27/AeroStream](https://github.com/Parcley27/AeroStream) to verify the privacy practices of the project.
